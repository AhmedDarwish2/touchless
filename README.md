# Touchless

## Touchless control for your PC

Note: Touchless does not yet work well with Leap Motion Orion, our new software designed specifically for Virtual Reality. If you enjoy using Touchless we recommend staying on the latest V2 version of the Leap Motion Software.

Use your Leap Motion Controller to interact with your Windows PC.

Touchless for Windows creates a virtual ‘touch’ screen in the air. Just lift your hand or finger to navigate your computer. Browse the web, open applications and documents, and control menu items — without touching anything.

Touchless for Windows includes basic and advanced levels, so you can choose your level of 3D interaction.
